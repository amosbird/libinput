.TH LIBINPUT "1"
.SH NAME
libinput \- tool to interface with libinput
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B libinput [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [ARGS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I libinput
tool creates a libinput context on the default seat "seat0" and interacts
with that libinput context.
.PP
This tool usually needs to be run as root to have access to the
/dev/input/eventX nodes.
.PP
The context created by this tool is a new libinput context and independent
of that created by the X.Org libinput driver, the Wayland compositor or any
other process that utilizes libinput (henceforth called "the caller").
Configuration options set in this context do not affect any other libinput
contexts.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
These options are independent of any
.B COMMAND
.TP 8
.B --help
Print help and exit
.TP 8
.B --version
Print the version and exit
.TP 8
.B --verbose
Enable verbose mode. In verbose mode, libinput will print a number of
debug messages to stdout. The exact behavior of verbose mode depends on the
.B COMMAND.
.TP 8
.B --quiet
Enable quiet mode. In quiet mode, most messages normally printed to stdout
will be omitted. The exact behavior of quiet mode depends on the
.B COMMAND.

.SH COMMANDS
All commands support a
.B --help
argument that prints command-specific usage
information
.TP 8
.B list-devices
List all devices recognized by libinput. See section
.B list-devices

.SS list-devices
List all devices recognized by libinput. Each device shows available
configurations the respective
.B default
configuration setting.
.PP
For configuration options that allow multiple different settings (e.g.
scrolling), all available settings are listed. The default setting is
prefixed by an asterisk (*).
.PP
Note that some specific feature may still be available on a device even when
no configuration is exposed, a lack of a configuration option does not
necessarily mean that this feature does not work.
.PP
Note that this command only lists
.B default
configuration settings, settings modified in other contextx by the caller
are not reflected in this tool.
.SH NOTES
.PP
A device may be recognized by this libinput context but not handled by the
X.Org libinput driver or the Wayland compositor.
